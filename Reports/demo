We were the last group ofthe day and watching all of the other groups burn their circuits had put a lot of stress on us. When it was our turn, we went up to the motor and conncted our circuit. We turned on the sources and the motor started rotating. As requested, we went up to full speed and then, we adjusted the speed with our potentiometer. After doing the main objective, we started to test our circuit under load. we also didn't know what was going to happen. As the load increased, the current increased and our MOSFET started heating up quickly. Our huge heat sink tried its best to cool down the MOSFET, however, it was not enough. The MOSFET went up to 250 degrees celcius, and it was holding up quite well until the 7th minute mark. at that point, we lost speed control not because the MOSFET burned down, but because the heat had melted down the soldering on the MOSFET, short circuiting its drain and source. However, at the end, we managed to boil up some water to make tea, which we consder as a success. In order to prevent this, we maybe should have used a bigger heat sink or a powerful fan to cool off the heatsink connected to the MOSFET.
