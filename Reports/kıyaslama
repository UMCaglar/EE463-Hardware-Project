In order to decide on which topology to choose, we had several things in mind. First of all, we should have decided on which bonuses to attempt. For example, if we wanted to do the "Four quadrant" bonus, we should have chosen a thyristor rectifier topology. However, controlling the thristors is more complicated than controlling a MOSFET because your circuit also needs to figure out when the input voltage hits zero, then give it a firing angle. This requires a more extensive work on the arduino coding and a more complicated circuit, increasing the error margin. Risking the whole project on a bonus that we are not certain to achieve did not seem logical to us. Another thing to consider about the thristor rectifiers is that due to its seeming more complicated to us, we figured it would take more time to design and implement. Since we were on a deadline, implementing the thristor rectifier did not look feasible to us. On the other hand, using the diode rectifier-buck converter topology is simpler in our opinion and all of the other bonuses are obtainable with it. The arduino programming is simple, all we needed to do was give out a variable duty cycle on a higher frequency than arduino's 490 Hz frequency. Aside from Arduino, the diode rectifier part is sold as whole, and we didn't need time to put it together and that is a big plus. The buck converter part looked simple enough to implement without error and therefore, we decided to go with the diode rectifier - buck converter topology.
